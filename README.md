# Lopsgen

For years, I used a bunch of scripts to generate my website for me. It
was easy, extensible and customized to my needs. I did not understand,
why I would need a static page generator for my simple website.

But over the years, it bothered me more and more, that my news feed on
my landing page is non-persistent, otherwise it would be overwhelming.
This was my motivation to implement this project.

It is a Lua-based, highly opinionated static page generator with a very
limited feature set to do not more but to meet my demands. This is also
the origin of the name - an akronym of the words *Lua, OPinionated, Site-Generator*.
